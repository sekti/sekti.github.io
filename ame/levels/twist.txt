[Level] The Twist (medium)

It's just two trees, so how hard can it be? As it turns out, harder than it looks. Clever use of the reset mechanic is required.

Hint 1: Both logs are needed on the eastern island.
Hint 2: The eastern log must form a horizontal bridge. You can get it to the correct tile, but only vertically.
Hint 3: Can you get the log in the water to twist?
Hint 4: The solution involves making a raft and resetting one of its logs.
Solution: Call the two water tiles between the islands N and S (“northern” and “southern”) and the logs/trees W and E (“western” and “eastern”). Get W to form a bridge at S. Then let E roll into N – it will be vertical. Reset W and also throw it into N – a horizontal raft will form. Reset W again, E will remain in N as a bridge. Roll W to the other island. Reset E. You now have both logs and can raft to your friend.
