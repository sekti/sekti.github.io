[Level] Sobriety Strictly Required (hard)

This level contains three islands of the original map. The indended way to reach the friend is, however, no longer available. Only a strange but interesting path remains that was discovered by Youtuber MocktailRS. The level's name is a tribute to him.

Hint 1: Get a single log from the bottom island to the main island. Afterwards, the bottom island is no longer needed.
Hint 2: Build a raft three tiles north of the left tree.
Hint 3: You need another raft on land as a (movable) platform.
